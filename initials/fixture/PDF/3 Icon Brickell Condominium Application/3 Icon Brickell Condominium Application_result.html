            PROCEDURES FOR RECEIVING OF PACKAGES
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>All packages received are stored and distributed directly by security. Packages received are immediately
            logged in, scanned and stored in a secure package room. Once the package is logged into our building’s smart
            system, an automated email and phone call is generated to the recipient advising them of their package
            arrival.</p>

        <p>Package guide lines are as follows:</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center">
            Any item delivered that requires two (2) or more persons to transport or weighs more than 50 lbs. will not
            be accepted.
            Packages considered to be too large/heavy may be denied at the association’s discretion.
            Packages will only be held for a maximum of 10 days. All unclaimed packages will be returned to sender on
            the 14th day.
            Packages may only be picked up by the receiver, whose name appears on the package. If the receiver wishes
            for another resident to pick-up the package, they must send a communication to the Association in advance.

        </p>


        <p>It is prohibited to send furniture through the mail as we do not have space to accept these large packages.
            To receive such deliveries, the use of the service elevator must be reserved through the association office.
            We are asking all residents that receive notice of a package arrival to please request their package
            directly from the security office (located at receiving dock level) during the following days and hours:</p>
        <p>Monday, Wednesday and Friday: 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
        <p>Tuesday and Thursday: 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
        <p>Weekends: Closed</p>


        <br/>

        <p>The Security Department will only release packages to the individual who the package is addressed to unless a
            written authorization from the consignee authorizing a second party to pick up the package is received.
            Please send written authorizations to carlos.lopez@whotels.com</p>
        <p>Packages will only be distributed to the recipient name referenced on the packaging label or the authorized
            second party, so please have appropriate identification available for verification.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 9px;">Should you have any questions regarding the building’s new package procedures or
            would like more information as to where the security office is located, please call, email or come by the
            association office and we will be happy to assist</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In order for all to enjoy the beautiful amenities at our community in a safe and organized manner, we kindly
